      <h2 id="section2">Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Isioma Pamela Talabi and I currently live in Abuja,
        Nigeria. I was born in Lagos Nigeria but grew up mostly in the Federal Capital Territory.
        <br><br>
        <b>Early Years</b>
        <br><br>
        My formative years were spent going to an Anglican Nursery and Primary School
        which was situated next to a bookshop. My momma is an avid reader and so,
        I became one too. Having a bookshop next to my school also helped my reading journey.
        By the time I was 10 years old, I had read a lot of famours writings by
        African Authors such as Chinua Achebe, Elechi Amadi, Flora Nwapa and Ngugi wa Thiong'o.

        I went on to study Economics and Development Studies in a private university in Nigeria
        where I graduated with a First Class Honours. After my graduation, I had a brief stint working
        as an investment banker in a financial institution. Soon after, I switched careers
        to the international development sector because I wanted to use my skills to help people around the world.

        I have now amassed over 10 years of working experience in the
        International Development sector with a brief stint in Investment
        Banking. Currently, I work as the Global Head of Knowledge Management
        & Learning at Save the Children International, where I lead
        organisational learning efforts and processes in over 120 countries.
        In 2017, I received a Commonwealth Scholarship Award to study
        International Development in the United Kingdoms after which I
        returned to Nigeria where I worked in the Office of the Vice President
        of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a Technical Assistant on SGBV
        Response. I have also worked with organisations such as PwC and
        Palladium in the areas of social justice and rural development. In my
        free time, I enjoy watching movies and trying out new cuisines with my
        husband and son.

      <h2 id="section3">Joining Alt School: My Reasons & Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I joined Alt School Africa in 2024 because I have always had a great
        love for creating new and beautiful things. I am fascinated by codes
        and beyond that, I love websites that look good and obey the
        principles of good design. I am also at the point where I would like to
        pivot my career into tech and gain a new set of skills.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section4">My Goals at Alt School</h3>
      <p>I intend to accomplish the following goals during my 1 year course at Alt School:
      <ol>
        <li>Develop proficiency in website programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React to build
          real-life businesses.</li>
        <li>Build a network of relationship with other developers.</li>
        <li>Develop a solid understanding of how to maintain workflows on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Improve my technical skills and interpersonal skills.</li>

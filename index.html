        <p>
          My name is Isioma Pamela Tàlàbí and I currently live in Abuja,
          Nigeria. I was born in Lagos Nigeria but grew up mostly in the Federal Capital Territory.
          <br><br>
          <b>Early Years</b>
          <br><br>
          <b>My formative years were</b> spent going to an Anglican Nursery and Primary School
          which was situated next to a bookshop. My momma is an avid reader and so,
          I became one too. Having a bookshop next to my school also helped my reading journey.
          By the time I was 10 years old, I had read a lot of famours writings by
          African Authors such as Chinua Achebe, Elechi Amadi, Flora Nwapa and Ngugi wa Thiong'o.
          <br><br>
          <b>I went on to study Economics and Development Studies </b>in a private university in Nigeria
          where I graduated with a First Class Honours. After my graduation, I had a brief stint working
          as an investment banker in a financial institution. Soon after, I switched careers
          to the international development sector because I wanted to use my skills to help people around the world.
          I have now amassed over 10 years of working experience in the
          International Development sector with a brief stint in Investment
          Banking. Currently, I work as the Global Head of Knowledge Management
          & Learning at Save the Children International, where I lead
          organisational learning efforts and processes in over 120 countries.
          <br><br>
          <b>In 2017, I received a Commonwealth Scholarship Award </b>to study
          International Development in the United Kingdoms after which I
          returned to Nigeria where I worked in the Office of the Vice President
          of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a Technical Assistant on SGBV
          Response. I have also worked with organisations such as PwC and
          Palladium in the areas of social justice and rural development. In my
          free time, I enjoy watching movies and trying out new cuisines with my
          husband and son.
